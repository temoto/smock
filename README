smock is Simple Mock for Python.

Fork of Ian Bicking's minimock.

Features:
    * monkey patching (replacing of original functions on-the-fly)
    * searching for functions through stack frame analysis
        (no ugly stupid __import__ asspain)
    * object specification through plain string like 'os.fork'
    * mocked objects call history
    * easy creating of simple mocks like return this or call that

Everything except call history is made by Ian Bicking.
